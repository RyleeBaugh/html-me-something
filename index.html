               <h2>Dookie</h2>
               <p>Dookie is a 10 year old Boston Terrior. Dookie is the first dog I got, me and my sister got Dookie as an early Easter present.
                  In late April, Dookie lost his left eye do to running into a conner of the wall, when he ran into the wall he also messed up his neck.
                  Despite Dookie losing an eye and hurting his neck, he is still just as playful as when he was a puppy.

               <h2>Bella</h2>
               <p>Bella is a 8 year old English Mastiff. Bella weighs about 150lbs and is around 5’7” standing on her back legs, even though Bella is the size of an adult human, 
                  she thinks she’s a lap dog and love to run under your legs looking for attention, she also plays with the other dogs like she’s the same size as them.</p>

               <h2>Jasmine (Jazz) and Moose</h2>
               <p>Jasmine, my family and I call her Jazz,  is a 12 year old American Black Lab and Moose is a 9 year old Black English Lab. 
                  Jazz and Moose are a new addition to the family, they moved in with us when their owner moved in. Jazz and Moose didn’t get along with Bella and Dookie at first; now they’re all pretty much inseparable.</p>

               <h2>Jack (Gum)</h2>
               <p>Jack is an 8 year old Lab/Husky mix. Jack got his nickname Gum when he was little, my little brother would call him “my good boy” and when he said it fast it sounded like “ma gumba” so he got the nickname Gum for being a good boy. 
                  Jack loves spending his day outside and sunbathing on the driveway and running around with my brother.
